## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  This project is about to train the model with images using ML model as processed(crop & resize) images of different gestures by generators.
- What is the background of your project?
  We use 3D conv for ML model. Generators(which are used to convert images as cropped and resized and to be feed into the model using fit_generator) are being used to generate around 663 (Train sequences, consists of video frames in each folder, which different classification, 100 sequences for validation.
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  Develop a feature that is used by smart TV recognizes the movmenet of hands with different gestures,and be controlled. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  Video frames for each video with different classes(as move up, down, swipe directions...) contains 663 sequences/videos (30 frames for each video contained in the respective forlder) for training, 100 sequences for validation.
